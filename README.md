## Pokemon TCG Price Analysis

#### Project Overview

This is a project of mine, a little professional, but very personal.  I love this hobby, so I set out to find and see if I can extrapolate some insights into card collecting.  At first, as I elaborate in the 'Introduction', I was going to find the best time to purchase cards based upon a years worth of data, but I found a popularity .csv and I thought about that instead.


#### Data Sources

CSVs:

1. tcgplayer.csv (gathered by my own webscraper)
2. pokemon-favorites-list.csv
