This entire folder will be dedicated to my undying pursuit to collect 'em all, for the most part.  I have a great big TODO list, of which is to make a .csv where I can add the new sets manually or, even more novel, where I can just have the sets added upon refresh by a webscraping script and added to binders.

Additionally, I'll be working through financials and pricing trends to find the best time to buy singles and sealed sets as well.

This place is the hub for my Pokemon madness.
