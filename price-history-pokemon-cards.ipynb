    "# When Best to Buy to Collect 'em All\n",
    "**When** I was a kid, [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) was all the rage.  At 9, I was regularly watching a VHS tape (dating myself, I know) that simply *talked* about the idea of catching them all.  I was hooked.  Like every fan's relationship with their hobby or interest, I had my ups and downs with the franchise and its various media, yet my adoration persisted.  There was one line of products that really caught my attention as a child.  It was the [Trading Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game) (TCG, for short), and came shortly after the [television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(TV_series)) and [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_video_games) and was just as big of a smash hit as the aforementioned two.  I jumped on the card game, doing everything from collect to 'battle' with them.  I collected in a large spurt (my mother's pocketbook suffered greatly) and was generally a giant pest.  I was spoiled, but unfortunately for me and fortunately for her, my love was short-lived.  Sadly, however, it was not because I just stopped, but it was more mental.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout my life I've been battling depression.  In college, I was formally diagnosed with dysthymia which is just fancy doctor-speak for persistent, long-term depression.  In my teens and twenties it was at its worst, I all but fell out of love with the card game and a lot of things in life.  It was only in my thirties that I realized hobbies are an important part of one's life and sense of self.  So, during the pandemic, I jumped into my closet and found the old cards I'd collected.  Unfortunately, I didn't take good care of my cards.  I remain undeterred though.  I'm 34 now, and my desire has never been higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I'm on a quest to fulfill what my childhood self wanted.  This notebook and project are with that in mind, to find deals, and figure out through pricing history and trends how best I can approach what almost every Pokémon aficionado strives so hard to do: to collect 'em all."

    "#### Goal(s) for this project:\n",
    "- analyzing trends and the overall history of sealed product and singles (individual cards) to find the best time to purchase them\n",
    "- people are different and like different types of Pokémon.  i want to analyze if those different people have different purchasing habits.\n",
    "- for longer term cards, i.e. 'vintage', i'll look through the various sets release and see if they forever mature or their price dips as well\n",
    "- finally, just to see if it works, there's a new set coming out in March or April -- i'll figure out when to buy them and have at it\n"

    "#### Expectations\n",
    "Insofar as my expectations are concerned, I think this is going to be super difficult.  This project wouldn't be possible without an API or a webscraper.  Luckily, I found a [REST API](https://pokemontcg.io/), which is the easier architecture of the two avialable (the other being SOAP) to make use of."
